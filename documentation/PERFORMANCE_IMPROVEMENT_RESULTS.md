## Technical Architecture

### Database Layer (PostgreSQL + Prisma)

#### Schema Enhancements:
```prisma
// Advanced indexing for performance
model Transaction {
  @@index([companyId, date])
  @@index([companyId, status, reconciliationStatus])
  @@index([companyId, accountId, date])
}

model Invoice {
  @@index([fromCompanyId, status])
  @@index([fromCompanyId, dueDate])
  @@index([clientId, issueDate])
}

model Client {
  @@index([companyId, status])
  @@index([companyId, industry])
  @@index([email, companyId])
}
```

#### Query Optimization:
- **Parallel Query Execution**: Multiple database operations run concurrently
- **Efficient Joins**: Optimized relations with selective field inclusion
- **Aggregation Queries**: Server-side statistics calculation
- **Pagination**: Skip/take with total count optimization

### API Layer (Next.js API Routes)

#### Endpoint Architecture:
```typescript
// Standardized response format
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T[]
  pagination: {
    total: number
    skip: number
    take: number
    hasMore: boolean
  }
  statistics?: {
    total: number
    [key: string]: any
  }
}
```

#### Performance Features:
- **Request Deduplication**: Automatic caching of identical requests
- **Server-side Filtering**: Reduced client-side processing
- **Bulk Operations**: Transaction-safe batch processing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with retry logic

### Client Layer (TanStack Query + React)

#### Hook Architecture:
```typescript
// Standardized hook pattern
export function useDataManagement() {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
    queryKey: [QUERY_KEY, params],
    queryFn: () => apiService.getData(params),
    staleTime: 2 * 60 * 1000, // 2 minutes
  })
  
  const mutation = useMutation({
    mutationFn: apiService.createData,
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: [QUERY_KEY] })
    }
  })
  
  return { data, isLoading, error, create: mutation.mutate }
}
```

#### Performance Features:
- **Smart Caching**: Automatic cache invalidation and updates
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback
- **Background Refetching**: Stale data updates
- **Request Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate API calls

## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Virtual Scrolling Implementation
```typescript
export function VirtualScrollList<T>({ 
  items, 
  itemHeight = 100,
  containerHeight = 400,
  renderItem 
}: VirtualScrollListProps<T>) {
  // Efficiently renders only visible items
  // Handles thousands of records without performance impact
}
```

### 2. Debounced Search
```typescript
export function useDebouncedSearch(initialValue = '', delay = 300) {
  // Prevents excessive API calls during search
  // Provides loading states for better UX
}
```

### 3. Parallel Query Execution
```typescript
const [data, totalCount, stats] = await Promise.all([
  prisma.model.findMany({ where, orderBy, skip, take }),
  prisma.model.count({ where }),
  prisma.model.aggregate({ where, _sum: {...}, _count: true })
])
```

### 4. Optimistic Updates
```typescript
const mutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: updateData,
  onMutate: async (newData) => {
    // Cancel any outgoing refetches
    await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey })
    
    // Snapshot the previous value
    const previousData = queryClient.getQueryData(queryKey)
    
    // Optimistically update to the new value
    queryClient.setQueryData(queryKey, newData)
    
    return { previousData }
  },
  onError: (err, newData, context) => {
    // Rollback on error
    queryClient.setQueryData(queryKey, context?.previousData)
  }
})
```
