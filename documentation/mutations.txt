Added isMutating prop to EventDialog - The dialog now accepts
  a loading state prop
  2. Updated button behavior - The submit button is now:
    - Disabled during mutation (disabled={isMutating})
    - Shows "Saving..." text while submitting
    - Prevents multiple clicks during submission
  3. Enhanced Calendar page - Now passes the isMutating state from
  the hook to the EventDialog
  4. Improved error handling - Added try/catch blocks to all
  mutation handlers to prevent unhandled promise rejections
  5. React Query mutation state - The isMutating combines all
  mutation states:
  const isMutating = createEventMutation.isPending ||
                     updateEventMutation.isPending ||
                     deleteEventMutation.isPending;

  How it prevents duplicates:
  - When user clicks "Add Event", the button immediately becomes
  disabled
  - The button text changes to "Saving..." to show progress
  - No additional clicks can trigger the mutation while one is in
  progress
  - Only after the mutation completes (success or failure) does the
   button become enabled again
